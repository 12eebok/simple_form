## I18n

SimpleForm uses all power of I18n API to lookup labels, hints and placeholders. To customize your forms you can create a locale file like this:

    en:
      simple_form:
        labels:
          user:
            username: 'User name'
            password: 'Password'
        hints:
          user:
            username: 'User name to sign in.'
            password: 'No special characters, please.'
        placeholders:
          user:
            username: 'Your username'
            password: '****'

And your forms will use this information to render the components for you.

SimpleForm also lets you be more specific, separating lookups through actions for labels, hints and placeholders. Let's say you want a different label for new and edit actions, the locale file would be something like:

    en:
      simple_form:
        labels:
          user:
            username: 'User name'
            password: 'Password'
            edit:
              username: 'Change user name'
              password: 'Change password'

This way SimpleForm will figure out the right translation for you, based on the action being rendered. And to be a little bit DRYer with your locale file, you can skip the model information inside it:

    en:
      simple_form:
        labels:
          username: 'User name'
          password: 'Password'
        hints:
          username: 'User name to sign in.'
          password: 'No special characters, please.'
        placeholders:
          username: 'Your username'
          password: '****'

SimpleForm will always look for a default attribute translation if no specific is found inside the model key. In addition, SimpleForm will fallback to default human_attribute_name from Rails when no other translation is found for labels.

Finally, you can also overwrite any label, hint or placeholder inside your view, just by passing the option manually. This way the I18n lookup will be skipped.

It's also possible to translate buttons, using Rails' built-in I18n support:

    en:
      helpers:
        submit:
          user:
            create: "Add %{model}"
            update: "Save Changes"

There are other options that can be configured through I18n API, such as required text and boolean. Be sure to check our locale file or the one copied to your application after you run "rails generate simple_form:install".
